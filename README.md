# The Customer Conundrum: Why a Surge in Customers Isn't Translating to Sales Growth - Design Thinking Based Project

## Project Overview: 
As a data analyst, I was tasked with investigating why Adventure Works, a bicycle manufacturer, was experiencing stagnant sales despite a significant increase in customers. In this project, I'll walk you through my analysis applying a human centric concept called Design Thinking, from data preparation to insights, and reveal the surprising reasons behind this paradox.

## Introduction
During a monthly review at Adventure Works, the sales team was filled with optimism as they celebrated a significant increase in new customers. However, the mood shifted when the sales manager posed a critical question: “Why aren’t our sales figures reflecting this growth?”

Determined to uncover the truth behind this paradox, I initiated an analysis to explore customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and sales trends. My goal was to determine why Adventure Works, despite its expanding customer base, was experiencing stagnant sales and to provide actionable insights to turn the tide.

### Stage 1: Empathizing
When the sales manager approached me with her question, I realized that to address her concerns effectively, I needed to see things from her perspective. Therefore, I focused on the empathy stage.

Understand the needs of Adventure Works' sales manager by asking key questions:
- Who are my stakeholders or who are the people viewing my dashboard?
  => Sales manager, sales team, marketing team => Use their language in my dashboard
- What are the goals of the stakeholders?
  => Gain insights into customer behaviors => Need something that helps identify which factors affect the buying decision
  => Analyze the disparity between customer growth and sales figures
  => Review the current sales performance landscape
- What challenges do they face in converting customers to sales?
  => Need a way to analyze the customer base.
- When do the stakeholders need my dashboard?
  => During meetings and discussions focused on analyzing insights, an interactive dashboard with preview insights could provide valuable assistance.
- Where do they see potential improvements in the sales process?
  => The sales trend, CLV, customer location, factors affecting buying decision, what products bring the highest revenue might reveal insights.
- Why is understanding customer behavior important to them?
  => The surge in customers without a corresponding increase in sales raises numerous questions. Stakeholders need to understand this disconnect in order to adjust their sales and marketing strategies effectively.
- How can I support their efforts to boost sales?
  => An interactive dashboard utilizing RFM analysis, along with my insights, can be invaluable. This tool will enable stakeholders to engage in informed discussions and explore further investigations based on the data presented.

2. Define Problem
Clearly articulate the core issue:

Northstar Metric: Focus on Sales as the key measure of success to directly address why increasing customer numbers aren’t driving revenue.
Point of View: Use RFM dimensions (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to segment customers and identify their unique characteristics.
Growth Formula: Formulate a strategy to enhance engagement with high-value customer segments to drive sales growth.
3. Ideate
Brainstorm solutions aimed at addressing the defined challenges:

Develop targeted marketing campaigns for different RFM segments.
Create personalized recommendations based on customer behavior.
Craft a compelling narrative to present these findings and strategies.

4. Prototype
Develop an Interactive Dashboard to visualize RFM segments alongside sales data, helping stakeholders explore customer contributions to sales. Refine it based on user feedback for clarity and impact.
